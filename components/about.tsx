			<p className="mb-3">
				After graduating with a master degree in <span className="font-medium">Business Economics</span>, I embarked on a journey as a Software Engineer based in Hannover, Germany. At E.ON, I have been able to professionalize my skills and gain hands-on experience as a <span className="font-medium">full-stack developer</span>, building modern and scalable web applications. Specializing in backend development, platform monitoring, and creating custom web applications using technologies like Typescript, React, Azure, C#, .NET, and MySql, I thrive on solving problems and overcoming challenges. My core stack is <span className="font-medium">React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB and MySql</span>. While beginning with no prior experience, my passion and drive for technology have helped me grow into a proficient software developer. Always eager to learn and improve, I believe in the mantra: <span className="font-medium">{`it's simple but not easy.`}</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span className="italic">When Im not coding</span>, I enjoy going to the gym, being with my dog, and cooking the most delicious food I can get my hands on. While this is just a small glimpse into my personal and professional life, I hope it provides a meaningful insight into who you will hopefully be working with.
