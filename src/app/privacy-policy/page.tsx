				<h3>Cookies</h3>
				<p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
				<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device’s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>
				<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.

				<h3>Request by Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
				<p>If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
				<p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.</p>

				<h3>Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)</h3>
				<p>We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships with us (master data). This is done based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process, and use your personal data when accessing our website (usage data) only to the extent necessary to enable you to access our service or to bill you for the same.</p>
				<p>Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>

				<h2>4. Plugins and Tools</h2>

				<h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
				<p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
				<p>For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web Fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our plugin. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
				<p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>
